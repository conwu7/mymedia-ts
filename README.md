## My Media Lists - Organized media lists

Check out the app at [MyMediaLists.app](https://www.allmylists.app/)

Instead of managing lists in every streaming service available or multiple apps, organize all your media in one single location. Create as many unique lists as you need for your tv shows and movies.

### Creating Lists

You can create new lists either from the ‘Add to list’ modal on the search tabs or copying/moving from the item another list.

Each list applies to only one form of media and is only shown on the media’s tab i.e. You can only add movies to a list with type of movies. To add items to a list, simple search for it and use the ‘Add to list’ button that is on each result.

By default, lists, and the items within them are sorted by old to new. You can change this to any of the following (Ascending or Descending) in the ‘More’ tab under ‘Preferences’ -

-       Name (list)
-       Date Created (list)
-       Title (media)
-       Date Added to List (media)
-       Release Date (media)
-       IMDB rating (media)

### Media Actions

You can choose a source for accessing content or streaming while selecting a list to add an item. This source will show up on the media tabs.

On each media item, there are five actions available. The first four are in a hidden menu above the media’s poster. Click on the three dots to expose the available actions.

1. Edit
-  Add/update to watch notes
-  Rate and add a review

2. Copy/Move items between lists.
3. Mark Completed – This will remove the item from the current list and add it to a 'Watched' list. The Completed list will always show up on the bottom of each page if it is not empty.

4. Remove – Remove the item from the current list.

The fifth action is available below the media’s poster. 5. More Info – view more info about the media. Consists of movie/episode runtime, total number of seasons, IMDB rating, cast.
